Examples
========

The ``examples`` folder holds Python runscripts that each solve a particular physics problem.

Simple Test Cases
-----------------

Many of the Python scripts inside the ``tests`` folder stress single components of Nidhoggr, or a small subset of them. For instance, 
``waveBox.py`` tests the acoustic wave solver with a single oscillatory source in the center of a box with two openings on either end 
(using Dirichlet boundaries to create the box).
