Usage
=====

As previously described, Nidhoggr is a compiled C++ codebase that is driven primarily by Python via 
compiled Python modules. If you're familiar with how NumPy works, you have most of the knowledge you'll 
need to understand how Nidhoggr works. In fact, while Nidhoggr does have many linear algebra classes and 
methods builtin, it often works best when paired with other popular Python modules, like NumPy and Matplotlib.

Importing Nidhoggr Modules
--------------------------

The ``nidhoggr.py`` file in the tests and examples directories imports all of the compiled Nidhoggr 
modules for you, and so if you wish to import the entire codebase, you can simply ``from nidhoggr import *`` 
However, you may choose to import only a subset of the available modules for your specific problem. Consult ``nidhoggr.py`` 
for the full list of modules.
